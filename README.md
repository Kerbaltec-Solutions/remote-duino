# remote-duino
system of docker containers to allow users to remotely upload and run scetches on a arduino connected to a rpi using NGINX

Remote-Duino is still in development and *not* ready for use

# Useage:

from the console run "./setup.sh" inside the main folder for the first configuration of the Docker environment. Do *not* run setup.sh as root user.

To restart the service run "./start.sh" in the same manner.

Beware, that when you run setup.sh, *all* files will be reset.
